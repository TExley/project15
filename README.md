# Project 15
The 15-puzzle coded in C using CSFML with an ida* solver to test the additive pattern database heuristic with 555 and 663 groupings. 
The 87 grouping uses too much memory and time for no reason since the 663 grouping finds the solution with no visible delay. Should work on Windows PCs.
